# Preventing Harassement

One of the major goals of the Clubhouse is to be a tool to protect people who otherwise might have been or could be harassed on other platforms.

## Types of Harassment

<https://privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/online-harassment-cyberstalking>

> Online harassment may involve threatening or harassing emails, instant messages, or posting information online. It targets a specific person either by directly contacting them or by disseminating their personal information, causing them distress, fear, or anger.

### Cyberstalking

Cyberstalking is a type of online harassment that involves using electronic means to stalk a victim, and generally refers to a pattern of threatening or malicious behaviors.  All states have anti-stalking laws, but the legal definitions vary. Some state laws require that the perpetrator make a credible threat of violence against the victim. Others require only that the stalkerâ€™s conduct constitute an implied threat.

Some examples of cyberstalking (and how we can help prevent):

* Sending manipulative, threatening, lewd or harassing emails from an assortment of email accounts.
	* Enable Group Organizers to hide personal info of the leadership team and the members.
		* The group organizer should have to choose to publish their private email
		* The platform should provide a non-email form to contact a group organizer (and maybe members in the future?)
			* Should block abuse like repeated uses of such form with some form of captcha?
				* <https://www.gravityforms.com/rip-captcha/>
			* Should be able to block IPs that.
			* Should (optionally) flag / delay messages with questionable content.
* Hacking into a victimâ€™s online accounts (such as banking or email) and changing the victimâ€™s settings and passwords.
	* Password need to force a level of security.
	* Consider offering 2FA or other security.
	* Discounts with Password Vendors?
* Creating false online accounts on social networking and dating sites, impersonating the victim or attempting to establish contact with the victim by using a false persona.
	* As long as group admins can filter membership additions this should be prevented.
* Posting messages to online bulletin boards and discussion groups with the victimâ€™s personal information, such as home address, phone number or Social Security number. Posts may also be lewd or controversial â€“ and result in the victim receiving numerous emails, calls or visits from people who read the post online.
	* Offer a way to report inappropriate content.
* Signing up for numerous online mailing lists and services using a victimâ€™s name and email address.
	* Use captcha to help avoid robots?

Group owners can remove people. It's not about getting them kicked out of Meetup or Facebook. They are removed from your group in total.

We could ban emails outright maybe?

## Photos

Before allowing people to upload photos we need to be able to filter out identifiable meta data.

Should work on a way for organizers to allow members to request removal.

Should work on a way for organizers to allow members to identify they wish not be in photos shared online.

Photos should rarely be shared on the public site unless blessed by the leadership.

## Give Organizers Easy Forms for Release

* Release forms for slides, recordings, photos, etc.
