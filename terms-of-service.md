Last updated: May 19, 2020

## 1. General

These General Terms apply generally to the use of the service IndieCampfire (the "Service" or "IndieCampfire"), and constitute a contract between you and the company providing the Service AS, Zorn Labs LLC ("The Company"). These terms govern your access to and use of the IndieCampfire application and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content"). Parts of the Service may display Content that is not IndieCampfire's ("User Content"). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that has made it available. When "Content" is used in this document, it refers to both content provided by IndieCampfire and User Content collectively, unless otherwise specified.

Where applicable, "The Company" shall also be understood as a reference to affiliates, suppliers, partners and other third parties IndieCampfire may engage or otherwise cooperate with in connection with the Service

By using IndieCampfire you agree to these General Terms and the [Privacy Policy](/) (collectively referred to as "Terms"). The Terms also include a [Data Processing Agreement (PDF)](https://d2qulvgqu65efe.cloudfront.net/IndieCampfire_Data_Processing_Agreement_Standard_Contract_Clauses_-_for_web.pdf). Please read them carefully. If you don't agree to the Terms, you can't use IndieCampfire.

We may change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on [GitHub](https://github.com/IndieCampfire/policy). If a change is material, we'll let you know before it takes effect provided that we have your correct email address. By using IndieCampfire on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don't agree to them, you should [delete your account](https://IndieCampfire.helpscoutdocs.com/article/349-manage-your-account-profile-and-data) before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Service and Content will be subject to the new Terms. For paid versions of the Services or Content that you have already purchased, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to any material changes, including price changes.

## 2. Age limitation

IndieCampfire is only for people **16 years old and over**. By using IndieCampfire, you affirm that you are over 16. If we learn that someone under 16 is using IndieCampfire, we'll terminate their account. For use in educational settings or use of our Meetings API in your own service, [contact us](mailto:sales@IndieCampfire.com).

## 3. How you can use the Service

The Free version of IndieCampfire is for legitimate individual use only (personal or business communication). Commercial use of IndieCampfire as part of your own business offering requires one of our paid plans or the Meetings API. Your use of IndieCampfire requires that you have hardware, software and an Internet connection fulfilling certain recommended requirements, as may be specified in [our Support Center](https://support.IndieCampfire.com). If the recommended requirements are not met, you may potentially still use the Service, but normally with a lower quality or performance. Such reduced quality or performance will not give you the right to claim any compensation from IndieCampfire.

To use certain parts of the Service, you will need to create a personal IndieCampfire account. You may register an account by following the instructions on the Website or other instructions prompted to you. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate and updated personal information, and for safeguarding your account information. You may not select or use an identity of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. You must use a valid email address, and IndieCampfire reserves the right to verify this at any time. IndieCampfire will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.

Your account is strictly personal and shall not be used by any other person without your supervision. Neither shall you assign your account to any other person. You are in any event solely responsible for the use of the Service through your personal user account.

We may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the Service or your account, at any time, without notice. We reserve the right to impose limitations of use based on what we consider fair or legitimate usage, both for free and paying users.

You are responsible for your use of IndieCampfire, including the lawfulness of any content displayed, shared, uploaded or otherwise made available by you in the Service ("the User Content"). User Content includes room names, and you are responsible for ensuring room names does not include Prohibited User Content (as listed below). Your room names are used to construct the links identifying your rooms, and guests you invite and other third parties can (request to) enter your rooms based on these links. As these guests do not need to authenticate to IndieCampfire in order to do this, please be aware that **room names must be considered public information**. Do not include information that you do not want to make public in room names.

### Restrictions on Content and Use of the Service We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.

We reserve the right to report illegal activity to applicable local authorities.

We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Service. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, Content that have been mislabeled or is otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content generated or made available via the Service.

We give you a personal, limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the software that is provided to you by us as part of the Service for your personal or business use. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Service as provided by us, subject to these Terms.

You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service, our internal computer systems including technical delivery systems of our subcontractors used to provide the Service; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Service by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by us (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us; (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Service to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Service or its users.

The Service may contain cryptographic functionality where the export of such could be restricted under applicable export control laws. You shall not export or re-export the Service or parts of it in violation of such laws or regulations.

### Charging for Use of the Services The Service is available as a Free plan for personal use, a paid Pro plan for professional use by individuals, and a Business plan for professional use by teams or organizations. We also offer a developer API ("Meetings API") as an extension of the Business plan, for customers who want to integrate IndieCampfire in their own products or tools.

As a Free user, you can at any time choose to upgrade your account, which will give you additional Pro features in the rooms you own. The Pro features will then be available to all guests visiting the room, even if they're anonymous. We reserve the right to change the features included in our plans, the price of the paid plan and the structure of the plan at any time.

The Business plan requires creation of a custom subdomain (*company.IndieCampfire.com*) and allows you as the account creator to invite other users to create a profile in the account. By signing up for a Business account, you confirm that you are a legal representative, or are acting on behalf of such person, of the company name used in the account subdomain. You may not set up an account that impersonates or infringes on other's trademarks. If your content or actions in the service or usage of our API violate any laws, including but not limited to spam, phishing, copyright infringement, defamation, computer attacks or fraud, we will terminate your service as soon as we find out.

You will find an updated overview of the content of the plans on our [Pricing page](https://IndieCampfire.com/information/pricing). Details around use and billing of the Meetings API will be outlined in the Order Form you as a customer commit to. We will notify all paying users of material changes to the content, price and terms of the plan.

All payments shall be made in advance or otherwise as laid out on the Pricing page. If your payment is not successful, your room will be downgraded to the Free plan with access to Pro features removed. If you have created more than one room during your Pro subscription, you will need to select one room to keep using with the IndieCampfire Free plan. Upgrading to Pro or Business will start a recurring subscription, and you will be billed every month in advance, on the day of month the subscription was first created. You can cancel the subscription at any time in the billing page, and you will then have access to Pro features for the remainder of the month you have paid for. When that month ends, your account will automatically be downgraded to the Free plan. Should you choose to reactivate your subscription before the account is downgraded, you will continue to have Pro features uninterrupted. In the case where payment fails for Pro and Business customers, you will be notified by email and inside the service. If repeated attempts to collect the payment fails, we may disable or block access to the account until payment of all invoices are settled. If payment is not received within a reasonable time, as outlined in our support center, the account will be downgraded to Free (for Pro) or deleted (for Business).
