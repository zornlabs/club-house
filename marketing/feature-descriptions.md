# Feature Descriptions

## Group Website

A custom website dedicated to your group and not the software hosting it. Start with a Clubhouse subdomain like `https://mygroup.clubhouse.host` or configure your own web domain for ultimate portability.

## Privacy Controls

Make a members-only private group or a public group where basic info is published but member privacy is still protected.

## Event Calendar

Create events and accept RSVPs.

## Member Profiles

Allow members to share their backgrounds and interests. 

## Leadership Team

Enable other members to help administer the group.

## Custom Membership Applications

Members can be added by hand or you can allow people to submit a membership application that can be accepted or declined by a group admin.

## Photos

Upload and share photos from events without publishing them to the public internet.

## API Access

We have a GraphQL API endpoint which allows full data access so you can build on top of our platform and backup your data.

## Mobile Web

Our HTML sites are built to respond to many different screen sizes allowing you to fully access the features while using a phone browser.

## Mobile Apps

While not explicitly planned for the 1.0 release, the long term goal is to provide native, open source, iOS and Android apps that utilize the API and provide a rich mobile experience (eg: push notifications, camera integrations).
