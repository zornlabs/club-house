<p>My name is <em>Mike Zornek</em> and I'm a fellow meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>I have a long history of participating in meetup groups; helping to organize the <a href="http://phillycocoa.org">Philly CocoaHeads</a> (an Apple developer group) for many years and am currently leading the <a href="https://phillyelixir.clubhouse.host/">Philly Elixir Group</a>.</p>
<p>Meetup groups are a great way to share and give back to your community. Through organizing meetups I have met some incredible peers, many who have become dear friends. I've learned a ton of technical knowledge and experienced countless career opportunities.</p>
<p>After a growing discontent with the meetup tools of the day I started to build out something new that let group organizers own their data and respected the privacy of group members. I am really excited how it's starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Please take a look for yourself and reach out to me. I'd love to hear about your own meetup experiences.</p>
