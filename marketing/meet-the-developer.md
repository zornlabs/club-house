# Meet the Developer

My name is *Mike Zornek* and I'm a fellow meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.

I have a long history of participating in meetup groups; helping to organize the [Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org) (an Apple developer group) for many years and am currently leading the [Philly Elixir Group](https://phillyelixir.clubhouse.host/).

Meetup groups are a great way to share and give back to your community. Through organizing meetups I have met some incredible peers, many who have become dear friends. I've learned a ton of technical knowledge and experienced countless career opportunities.

After a growing discontent with the meetup tools of the day I started to build out something new that let group organizers own their data and respected the privacy of group members. I am really excited how it's starting to take shape.

Please take a look for yourself and reach out to me. I'd love to hear about your own meetup experiences.
