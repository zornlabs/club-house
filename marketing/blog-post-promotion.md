# Blog Post Promotion

As part of our marketing efforts we should publish regular blog posts. Content on `blog.clubhouse.host` should be focused on user needs and product education. Generalized tech posts will be pushed to `mikezornek.com` to keep the blog focused. This isn't to say we can't do occasional tech posts but they should be specific to a Clubhouse activity like "Introduction to GraphQL" to explore our own API.

## Promoting Blog Posts

[ ] Have a working RSS Feed at all times and promote this in the page design.
[ ] Incorporate visuals for more attractive sharing links
[ ] Post links to post to the Micro.Blog account which will be cross posted to the Twitter account.
[ ] If relevant enough, post to personal `zorn` Micro.Blog account which will be cross posted to Twitter. 
[ ] Include blog links in monthly newsletter

Future Ideas:

[ ] Make sure links expand in slack/twitter.
[ ] Have a working JSON Feed?

## Brainstorming Blog Posts

* Do marketing research on search phrases / forum questions and build around those.
