# Terminology

The core terms and their meaning inside the project.

## Clubhouse (Project Name)

The full name of the project is **Clubhouse**. The name of the group website-hosting platform is **Clubhouse Hosting**.

Note: The project mistakenly used the incorrect spelling "Club House" in the past. This is being corrected over time but can still be found in some aspects of the server.

## Terms

* Group Site - refers to the (usually public) website that general members visit and conduct typical business (RSVP-ing for an event, uploading a photo, editing their profile).
* Group Admin Site - refers to the admin-only area where organizers can view, create, edit and delete all data related to the group.

* **Admin Bar** - if you can administer a group, while browsing the group site you'll see a series of admin like navigation links and tools across the top.

## Actions

* **Sign In** and **Sign Out** are preferred over login or log in.

* Create / Edit / View / Delete 

Q: Should we use "New" next to Events? the form itself is labeled "New Event"

Q: What do we call the event detail page? Feels wrong to use a link "View" to get to it. Link should be a noun.
