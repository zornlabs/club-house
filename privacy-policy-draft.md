# Privacy Policy

An early draft I was working on based on this:

https://whereby.com/information/tos/privacy-policy/

I'm not married to the format or anything. Generally like the plain language of it. 

Thought you might get value out of some of the technical details I started to document.

Effective date: May 18th, 2020

This Privacy Policy is provided by: Zorn Labs LLC as "IndieCampfire"/"we".

## Introduction

This policy describes what information we collect when you use IndieCampfire's sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content ("Services"). It also provides information about how we store, transfer, use, and delete that information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

This policy applies to IndieCampfire's meetup group tools, including websites, mobile applications, and other IndieCampfire websites (collectively "the Websites"), as well as other interactions (e.g. customer support conversations, user surveys and interviews etc.) you may have with IndieCampfire.

This policy applies where we are acting as a Data Controller with respect to the personal data of users of our Services; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data. For content and data that you upload to or make available through the Service ("User Content"), you are responsible for ensuring this content is in accordance with our Terms of Service, and that the content is not violating other users' privacy.

## How and What Information We Collect, Process and Store

IndieCampfire is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. Our business model does not rely on widespread collection of general user data. We will only collect and process information that we need to deliver the service to you, and to continue to maintain and develop the service.

IndieCampfire may collect, store and process various kinds of data, with different legal grounds, as listed below. For the categories of data that require your consent, we will actively ask you for consent before collecting any data. You can give and revoke your consents at any time in your group's account settings page.

FIXME: The name/link of this page might change.

The following is a list of data we collect, process or store, with the purpose and legal ground listed for each item or group of items having the same purpose and legal ground.

For more on how this information is used, shared and published see additional sections below.

FIXME: Make headers have periods and be lower case?

**Group Identity Information** To create a group you will provide a group name and subdomain for the group website. The group will also be assigned a time zone based on the browser data of the person creating the group. This time zone can be manually edited later. During the setup of your group a group summary as well as a group privacy level will be collected. More on how this privacy level effects publishing behavior can be found below. Finally during group setup, information for the initial member, admin and owner of the group will be collected.

**Member Account Information** People that choose to register as a member of a group using IndieCampfire, will have to provide a valid email address. This and other member data described below is accessible by a group owner for the purpose of allowing group operations to move to another service and this scoped use is protected under our Terms of Use. Member data, including name and bio, is not shared even with the general membership at large unless consent is granted.

**Passwords** To help authenticate our users we ask they setup a password. Passwords are never stored in plain text. A salted unidentifiable hash is created based on the password and that is stored. Password hashes are not available as part of the data export features or API for security reasons.

**Event Details** A core feature of our groups is the ability to create a topical event where members will interact, ether in-person or online. For each event a title, description and time are collected.

**Event RSVPs** To help keep track of event participation an Event RSVP can be created between a member and an event. In addition to the confirmation or decline a member can also consent to publish this RSVP for group use.

**Transaction information** To host a group website on IndieCampfire requires a payment subscription. Customers will share with IndieCampfire (and our payment processors) billing details such as credit card information, billing email, banking information, and a billing address. 

> The transaction data may be processed for the purpose of supplying the purchased services and keeping proper records of those transactions. This data may be used for the purpose of delivering the Services to you. Processing this information is required for fulfilling the contract we entered into with you, at your request (our Terms of Service) cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item b. Additionally, this information needs to be retained in order to comply with accounting and tax regulation cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item c.

FIXME: Verify against paddle privacy?

**Usage information** When you as a user interact with the Services, we collect and process metadata to provide additional context about the way the Service is being used. The usage data may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your service use. The source of the usage data is our server software and our analytics tracking system.

* **Product Analytics Data** IndieCampfire logs activities by you when you interact with our websites or apps.
* **Technical Log Data** Like most digital services, our servers automatically collect information when Websites or Services are accessed or used and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited within the Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
* **Device Information** IndieCampfire may collect and process information about devices used to access the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data.
* **Location Information** We receive information from you and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. For example, when creating a group we collect your currently observed time zone and use that for the group's default time zone.

	> The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f, namely using this data for the purpose of ensuring the proper administration of our website and business, analyzing the use of the website and services, monitoring and improving our website and services, improving the user experience, preventing abuse, and assisting users with support inquiries. For information about cookies and how to opt out of cookies, see our Cookie Policy.

**Customer Support Information** We may process information that you send to us, should you choose to submit a ticket to our support email. If you contact us, we may use your Account, Transaction or Usage Information to respond.

> Processing this information it is required for performing the contract we entered into with you, at your request (our Terms of Service), as well as our legitimate interest of handling your requests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f.

**Product & Marketing Communication** We may process information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our email newsletters. You can opt in to emails through your account's "Settings > Privacy > Consents" page. 

FIXME: Add correct link.

> The notification data may be processed for the purposes of sending you relevant product information or newsletters. The legal basis for this processing is your consent cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item a.

**Service and Transactional Notifications** Sometimes we'll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can't opt out of this type of "service or transactional" emails (unless you delete your account) as they are necessary information for the Services. 

> The legal grounds for processing this information is that it is required for performing our commitment about communicating changes in plans and pricing to you in the contract we entered into with you, at your request (our Terms of Service) cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item b, and our legitimate interest of communicating important information about your account to you, cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f.

**Correspondence Information** We may process information that you choose to share with us if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with IndieCampfire. 

> The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests cf. GDPR art. 6 (1) item f, namely the proper administration of our website and business and communications with users.

## How Group Information is Published

**Data Ownership and Group Portability** As you join and participate in a group you are not only granting IndieCampfire access to use your data according to this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use but also to the group owner, maintaining their ability to build on top of the IndieCampfire platform as well as the ability to migrate that group data to another system should they want to. Group Owners agree to honor all privacy consent details of such data.

**Group Privacy Level** Regardless of a group privacy level, the group's subdomain (The `mygroup` in `https://mygroup.indiecampfire.com`) is always a matter of public record and can not be hidden. For each group you can choose a privacy level of either "Private" or "Public". These dictate the publication behaviors described below:

* **Private Groups:** Other than subdomain, all other content in a private group, including the group name and summary require a signed-in member to be viewed and are not listed on the public internet.
* **Public Groups:** For public groups the group name and summary are published to the public internet. 
	* Event details like title, description, location and time are also published to the public internet. If an event has an online meeting URL, that will only be shared with members who have RSVP'd in the affirmative.
	* Event RSVP information is only visible to signed-in members and when it has been marked as shared by said member. 
	* The Membership List is never published to the public internet and requires a signed-in member to be view.
	* Individual Member Profiles are only published with consent.
	* Public groups optionally can offer a form to allow non-members from the public internet the opportunity to apply for membership. These submissions must consent to the storage of said application by the group owner. Admins will then accept or decline the application, creating a new member if accepted.

**API Access** Accessing non-public data through the API requires token-based authentication which enforces all previously described data visibility rules. An individual member can see the data they have been granted to see, and a group owner/admin has much broader data visibility to enable Group Data Ownership and Group Portability.

## Providing your personal data to others

We may share information about with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (4) to protect the vital interest of others, when we have reason to believe that doing so will prevent harm to someone or illegal activities.

Our categories of service providers and partners are:

* Hosting/infrastructure/storage providers
* Payment processors
* Analysis tools providers
* Customer Support tools providers
* Marketing and email providers
* Recruiting tools providers
* Internal communication tools providers

### Business Transfers

We may disclose your personal data to any member of our group of companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy.

In the case where we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we will notify you in advance and give you the option to delete your data before the transfer.

## Retaining and deleting personal data

Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

We will retain your personal data as follows:

* Transaction information will be retained for a minimum period of 5 years following date of the transaction, and for a maximum period of 10 years following the date of the transaction.

In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the following criteria:

1. Account information will be retained until you decide to delete your account or the group itself is deleted in IndieCampfire.
2. Information about you used for Product & Marketing communication will be retained as long as you have given us consent to use this information.
3. The period of retention of usage information will be determined based on the need for historical data to determine statistical validity and relevance for product decisions and technical monitoring.

Regardless of the provisions above, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

## Changes to this policy

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub. If a change is material, we'll let you know before it takes effect. By using IndieCampfire on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don't agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Service and Content will be subject to the new Terms.

### Managing and deleting your personal information

If you have an IndieCampfire account, you can access, modify or export your personal information, or delete your account in Settings. If you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time. You may instruct us at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes, by adjusting your Privacy settings). We may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.
